# Hi, i'm Kelvin.

4th year Medical Student. I use Git for backup my Linux Desktop Environment and configs, some nice app's code source and my own medical study resources.

Sometimes i take a look at programming only when i have a bit of time.

My medical studies are the most important thing for me, so I try to make technology a help and not a distracting setback.
